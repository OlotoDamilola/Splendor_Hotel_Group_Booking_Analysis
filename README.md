# Splendor_Hotel_Group_Booking_Analysis
# Analyzing data in Power Query and Power BI
# Introduction
This is a personal related project. I analyzed a dataset from Splendor Hotel Group booking data. The task involves a thorough analysis of a comprehensive dataset featuring intricate details of bookings, guest demographics, distribution channels and financial metrics. The dataset contained 199,390 rows and 17 columns. The following variables are included in the detailed data file:

a) Hotel: Type or name of the hotel within the Splendor Hotel Group.

b) Booking Date: The date when the booking was made.

c) Arrival Date: The date when the guests are scheduled to arrive.

d) Lead Time: The number of days between the booking date and arrival date.

e) Distribution Channel: The channel through which the booking was made (e.g., Direct, Onliine Travel Agent).

f) Country: Country of origin of the guests.

g) Revenue: The revenue generated from the booking.

The aim of this research is to extract meaningful insights that will not only inform operational improvements but also contribute to the overall success of Splendor Hotel Group in delivering unparalled hospitality.

# Data Profiling, Data Modeling and Data Transformation 
After importing my data into power query, I checked for the validity of my data using column distribution, quality and profiling. I also made sure my columns were in the rigth data type. The calendar DAX function was used to construct a calendar table based on the arrival and booking dates. For efficient analysis, the tables were then combined with the fact table. THe switch DAX function was used to group the lead time into four categories to obtain the lead time contributing significantly to revenue and the cancellation rate. 

# Data Analysis and Visualizations 

A) REVENUE

![rev_rev_loss](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Splendor_Hotel_Group_Booking_Analysis/assets/109422215/c651b60b-a3af-4ad0-9c91-8509fa7be204)

Bookings are made very early in the year. For city hotel, January and February has the most number of bookings at 10738 & 9008. Additionally, it was observed that bookings made by transient customers are most likely to occur in January or February. Contract, group and transient party customers make most of their bookings in October, which made it the third month with most booking at 8032. This is comparable to resort hotel, however the only customer likely to make a post in October is transient party customers.


B) CUSTOMERS

![ADR rev month](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Splendor_Hotel_Group_Booking_Analysis/assets/109422215/2b4f6b3a-299d-4ba2-a324-9dbb1cff5083)

An increase in average daily rate correlated with an increase in the total revenue. Average daily rate reached its peak of $140 in August. For city hotel, average daily rate reached its peak of $122 in May while resort maintained its peak in August at $186. 

![ADR cancel month](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Splendor_Hotel_Group_Booking_Analysis/assets/109422215/8b7291ee-a18e-48be-a3ec-c7f0c62faa05) 

An increase in average daily rate correlated with an increase in cancellation. The summer months saw the greatest number of cancellations, with August having the highest percentage at 11.9%. In October 2016, the 12.4% cancellation rate came as a shock. This occured due to 11.5% cancellation rate from transient customers who made their booking earlier in the year. 

![rev customer](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Splendor_Hotel_Group_Booking_Analysis/assets/109422215/d683a014-0ec7-433c-ac52-c484db02e897)

By a far distance, transiennt customers generates the most revenue for Splendor Hotel Group both for city and resort hotel. 87% of the revenue generated by transient customers are from customers who completes their desired stay in the hotel and checks out.

![rev lead time](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Splendor_Hotel_Group_Booking_Analysis/assets/109422215/83ebd294-60c4-4d93-b6f0-a1432af10201)

In 2015, all lead time groups combined generated an average of $198,530 in revenue, with their lowest revenue being near the end of the year. In 2016, the overall revenue rose in March for all lead time group and it continued to rise only for days greater than 90. This pattern continued until August when it started to decline once more and ended the year at $227,005. This trend occured again the following year, which means revenue tend to start slow in the begining of the year and then increased in the summer. August 2017 saw revenue hit its peak of $1,256,977 for group greater than 90 days. From 2015 - 2017, other lead time groups averages total revenue of $240,474.

There was a significant decline in revenue due to the high cancellation rate for group longer than 90 days between July and November of 2015. May 2017 saw group longer than 90 days hit its highest cancellation rate of 4.37% leaving the revenue at $970,836. It further reduced towards towards the end of the year and settled at 2.84%. All other lead time grou had a cancellation rate lesser than 1%. However, the lesser the cancellation, the higher the revenue generated.

# Recommendations

a) Reducing the average daily rate in the summer (July - September) might decrease the cancellation rate.

b) Creating a system that offers discount to lead time more than 90 days for summer bookings.

c) Request for feedback and ratings from customers to identify areas of concerns to reduce cancellations.
